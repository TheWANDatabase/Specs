# Donator Perks

The project costs a decent chunk of change per month to run, and despite all cost saving measures I am taking to ensure
it costs as little as possible, I still need to pay for the server, the domain, and the time I spend working on the
project. As such, I have decided to offer a few perks to those who are willing to donate to the project. These perks can
be attained via one of two means, either a monthly subscription, or a one time payment which will grant you credit up
front to decide how to spend (if you want to spend it at all).

## How to Donate

Donations will be enabled via a page on the website, which will allow you to choose between the monthly subscription,
the annual subscription, or the one time payment option. Users who select the one time payment option
will be greeted with a page which allows them to input how much they wish to donate, and select which perks they wish to
receive. Users who select the monthly or annual subscription will be forwarded to the payment gateway to complete their
subscription.

Perks will be enabled on your account within 24 hours, and you will receive an email confirming your perks have been
enabled.

## How to Spend

If you chose the on time payment option, your account will have credits applied to it, which you can choose how to spend
on your profile page. There will be a toggle that allows you to switch between "Supporter" and "Supporter +", your
credits will be billed accordingly for the perks you select, however you will be billed the monthly amount from that
credit balance, as annual billing is only available for subscribers.

## How to Cancel

You can cancel you subscription in any one of two ways

1. You can email me directly, and I will cancel your subscription for you
2. You can cancel your subscription via the button on your profile page (this will not cancel your subscription, but
   will instead cancel the auto-renewal of your subscription), and you will be able to continue to use your perks until
   the end of the billing period.

## How to Change

You can change your subscription in any one of two ways

1. You can email me directly, and I will change your subscription for you manually, and you will be billed accordingly
   for the remainder of the billing period
2. You can cancel your subscription via the button on your profile page (this will not cancel your subscription, but
   will instead cancel the auto-renewal of your subscription), and you will be able to continue to use your perks until
   the end of the billing period, at which point you can re-subscribe to the new tier.

## FAQ

#### Why are you charging for this?

I am not charging for the core functionality of the site, however I need to pay for the server, the domain, and the time
I spend working on the project. This project has consumed more than 500 hours of my time since starting my efforts back
near the beginning of 2023 and I have spent a significant amount of my personal money getting the project running. I am
not asking for much, but I would like to be able to continue doing this work for you all.

#### What if I can't afford to donate?

If you can't afford to donate, that's fine, I understand that not everyone can afford to donate. You won't be negatively
affected by not having any of the features listed above, and I have worked very hard to ensure that the site is still a
great experience for everyone, regardless of if they donate.

#### What is "LTT Store Product Archives"?

LTT Store Product Archives is a feature which allows you to view all the products featured in an episode, so long as
their respective LTT Store page was active at the time of archival or shortly after. This feature allows us to see
what products were featured in the show and in future updates, we may allow you to filter episodes by which products
were shown off

#### What is "Complete Merch Message Archive"?

Complete Merch Message Archive is a feature which allows you to view all the merch messages featured in an episode,
not only those mentioned in topics, but also those which made it onto the screen. The goal is to try and archive as many
merch messages as we can, this also means that we could allow you to search for merch messages by keyword, or by who
responded to the message (if we can figure that out)

#### What are "Discord Perks"?

Discord Perks are perks which allow you to get a special role on the Discord server, which will allow you to access a
supporters only channel. This channel will be used to discuss upcoming features, and to get feedback on new features
before they are announced to the public.

#### What is "Audio Only Playback"?

Exactly what is says on the tin, instead of streaming a video to you, we will stream an audio only version of the video
to your device. This allows you to not waste bandwidth loading pixels you don't want to see, and is great for those who
want to listen to the show whilst doing other things, or who view it as an audio podcast.
